over and over again. Violating one of the core principles of good development — Don’t Repeat Yourself.

"I've built my career developing solutions for mutli-million dolor companies on the shoulders of other developers creating frameworks,
answering tough questions on public forums and open source projects that propelled me farther than I could ever do on my own.
This is my humble attempt to give back what countless others have already given me." - Founder, Daniel Hindi
